            The possibilities for what developers can dream up and build for
            Apple Vision Pro are endless. And with familiar tools and frameworks
            like Xcode, SwiftUI, RealityKit, and ARKit, as well as support for
            Unity and the 3D-content preparation app Reality Composer Pro,
            developers have everything they need to create amazing spatial
            experiences.

              Testing conducted by Apple in November 2023 using preproduction
              Apple Vision Pro units and software. Testing consisted of full
              battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks:
              video playback, internet browsing, spatial video capture, and
              FaceTime. Video playback tested in conjunction with an
              Environment, using 2D movie content purchased from the Apple TV
              app. Internet browsing tested using 20 popular websites. FaceTime
              tested between two Apple Vision Pro units with Personas enabled.
              Tested with Wi-Fi associated to a network. Battery life depends on
              device settings, usage, network, environmental conditions, and
              many other factors. Battery tests are conducted using specific
              Apple Vision Pro units; actual results may vary.
